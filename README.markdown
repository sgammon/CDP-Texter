##Notes

* **Sam, 10-18-2010**
> This app was completed in a day... the client (California Democratic Party) requested super-rapid development, so it's quick and dirty. Not a very pretty interface and no stability testing... app also incorporates no caching or performance-enhancing features of any kind. DON'T JUDGE ME
